Raymond Tang's dotfiles
=======================

pianobar scrobbler event helper also needs something in the home directory. Provided here: [https://gist.github.com/Raytray/5021019](Here)  
My gitconfig has a few changes for colors, as well as aliases for more ease of use.
xkbevd is for bell beeps. My systems do not contain an actual pcspkr, thus I use aplay and xkbevd to catch events and emit a short beep.
bashrc is not listed as I use zshrc instead.
Further documentation to come later.
